## **End-to-End Guide for My SQL Project – Dishcover**

This guide walks through everything I did to build a **SQL project based on Dishcover**, a fictional food delivery company. I’ve broken down each step from **setting up the database** to **solving real-world business problems using SQL**. This helped me practice **real-time data handling** and **analytical thinking**.

---

## **Step 1: Setting Up PostgreSQL and pgAdmin 4**

**1. Installing PostgreSQL:**
I downloaded and installed PostgreSQL from the official website. During setup, I set a password for the default `postgres` user (you’ll need it later).

**2. Installing pgAdmin 4:**
I installed pgAdmin 4 — a **graphical interface** that simplifies managing PostgreSQL databases.

**3. Launching pgAdmin 4:**
After installation, I launched pgAdmin 4 and **logged in using the password** I created during setup.

---

## **Step 2: Creating the Database**

**1. Setting Up My Database:**
Inside pgAdmin 4, I right-clicked on **"Databases" → "Create"** and made a new database called `dishcover_db`. The owner was kept as `postgres`.

---

## **Step 3: Creating Tables**

**1. Building the Tables:**
Under **Schemas → Tables**, I created the core tables:
`restaurants`, `customers`, `orders`, `riders`, and `deliveries`.

I carefully defined:

* **Data types**
* **Primary and foreign keys**
* **Constraints** to maintain data integrity

---

## **Step 4: Importing Data**

**1. Getting the Data Ready:**
I ensured that my **CSV files matched the structure** of my tables — column names, formats, and datatypes.

**2. Importing in pgAdmin:**
Using **Import/Export** in pgAdmin, I:

* Selected the CSV file
* Mapped the columns correctly
* Ran the import

This loaded all my data into the tables.

---

## **Step 5: Checking for Null Values**

**1. Finding Missing Data:**
I wrote **SQL queries** to check for null values in important columns.

**2. Handling Nulls:**
Depending on the context, I:

* **Removed rows**
* **Filled in missing values**
* **Flagged records** for manual review

---

## **Step 6: Doing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

**1. Getting to Know the Data:**
I ran **basic SELECT queries** to explore:

* Record counts
* Unique values
* Table relationships

**2. Visualizing the Data:**
I used:

* **pgAdmin options**
* **Excel or Python** (for bar charts, histograms, etc.)

This helped identify **trends and outliers** visually.

---

## **Step 7: Basic Data Analysis**

**1. Running Basic Queries:**
I started with simple analysis like:

* Total orders
* Average order value
* Top restaurants/customers

**2. Summarizing Key Insights:**
I focused on key metrics like:

* **Total revenue**
* **Active users**
* **Order frequency**

These insights helped evaluate Dishcover's **business performance**.

---

## **Step 8: Solving the 20 Business Questions**

**1. Understanding the Questions:**
I used a curated list of **20 business-focused SQL problems** to simulate real-world scenarios.

**2. Breaking Down Each Problem:**
For each question, I:

* Identified relevant tables
* Wrote the query step-by-step
* Tested and validated logic

**3. Saving My Work:**
I documented all my **SQL queries** in a well-organized format.

**4. Presenting the Results:**
I compiled all outputs to prepare a **dashboard or report**, making it look professional for sharing.
